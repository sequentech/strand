Strand is a cryptographic library for use in secure online voting protocols. 

## Primitives

The following primitives are implemented

* ElGamal and exponential ElGamal encryption.

* Fixed distributed and [threshold distributed ElGamal].

* [Wikstrom] [shuffle] [proofs].

* Schnorr and Chaum-Pedersen zero knowledge proofs.

Shuffle proofs have been independently verified

* [Did you mix me? - Formally Verifying Verifiable Mix Nets in Electronic Voting] using [OCamlBraid].

## Group backends

The library supports pluggable [discrete log] backends, there are currently three:

* Curve25519 using the [ristretto group] via the [curve25519-dalek] library.
* [Standard multiplicative groups] via the [rug] arbitrary-precision library, backed by [gmp].
* [Standard multiplicative groups] via the [num-bigint] arbitrary-precision library, in pure rust.

## Significant dependencies

* Compute intensive portions are parallelized using [rayon].
* Symmetric encryption using [RustCrypto](https://github.com/RustCrypto/block-ciphers).
* Serialization of intermediate byte trees using [bincode](https://crates.io/crates/bincode) and serde.
* Randomness is sourced from [rand::rngs::OsRng], in wasm builds [getrandom] is backed by [Crypto.getRandomValues].

## Continuous Integration

There are multiple checks executed through the usage of Github Actions to verify
the health of the code when pushed:
1. **Compiler warning/errors**: checked using `cargo check` and 
`cargo check ---tests`. Use `cargo fix` and `cargo fix --tests` to fix the 
issues that appear.
2. **Unit tests**: check that all unit tests pass using `cargo test`.
3. **Code style**: check that the code style follows standard Rust format, using
`cargo fmt -- --check`. Fix it using `cargo fmt`.
4. **Code linting**: Lint that checks for common Rust mistakes using 
`cargo clippy`. You can try to fix automatically most of those mistakes using
`cargo clippy --fix -Z unstable-options`.
5. **Code coverage**: Detects code coverage with [cargo-tarpaulin] and pushes
the information (in master branch) to [codecov].
6. **License compliance**: Check using [REUSE] for license compliance within
the project, verifying that every file is REUSE-compliant and thus has a 
copyright notice header.
7. **Dependencies scan**: Audit dependencies for security vulnerabilities in the
[RustSec Advisory Database], unmaintained dependencies, incompatible licenses
and banned packages using [cargo-deny]. Use `cargo deny fix` or
`cargo deny --allow-incompatible` to try to solve the detected issues. We also
have configured [dependabot] to notify and create PRs on version updates.
8. **Benchmark performance**: Check benchmark performance and alert on
regressions using `cargo bench` and [github-action-benchmark].
9. **CLA compliance**: Check that all committers have signed the 
[Contributor License Agreement] using [CLA Assistant bot].

## Development environment

strand uses the [Nix Package Manager] as its package
builder. To build strand, **first [install Nix]** correctly
in your system.

After you have installed Nix, enter the development environment with:

```bash
nix develop
```

## Updating Cargo.toml

Use the following [cargo-edit] command to upgrade dependencies to latest
available version. This can be done within the `nix develop` environment:

```bash
cargo upgrade -Z preserve-precision
```

This repository doesnÂ´t include a `Cargo.lock` file as it is intended to work as a library. However for Wasm tests we keep a copy of the file on `Cargo.lock.copy`. If you update Cargo.toml, keep the lock copy file in sync by generating the lock file with `cargo generate-lockfile`, then `mv Cargo.lock Cargo.lock.copy` and commit the changes.

## building

This project uses [nix](https://nixos.org/) to create reproducible builds. In order to build the project as a library for the host system, run:

```nix build```

You can build the project as a WASM library with:

```nix build .#strand-wasm```

If you don't want to use nix, you can build the project with:

```cargo build```

### Build with parallelism

Uses rayon's parallel collections for compute intensive operations

```cargo build --features=rayon```

## unit tests

```cargo test```

## wasm test

See [here](https://github.com/sequentech/strand/tree/main/src/wasm/test).

## benchmarks
